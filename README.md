# üß† AksharAI: CNN-Based Real-Time Devanagari Handwritten Character Recognition

## üåé Project Abstract

This repository presents an end-to-end deep learning solution for recognizing handwritten characters in the Devanagari script, a widely used writing system for several Indian languages including Hindi, Sanskrit, and Marathi. The system demonstrates a robust machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to real-time deployment via a web interface.

At the core of the application lies a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras**, trained to identify and classify 46 distinct Devanagari characters. This model is seamlessly deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to draw characters on an interactive canvas and receive instant predictions. This project highlights the convergence of deep learning, intuitive UI design, and reproducible research workflows.

## ‚ú® Core Features & Technical Highlights

* **Interactive Drawing Interface:**
  Built using `streamlit-drawable-canvas`, this feature provides an intuitive drawing space for users to input Devanagari characters using mouse or touch. The canvas output is captured as image data, which is processed and fed into the trained CNN model.

* **Robust CNN Model:**
  A sequential convolutional neural network trained on grayscale 32x32-pixel images. It leverages multiple convolution and pooling layers to capture both low-level and high-level features crucial for accurate classification.

* **Optimized Data Pipeline:**
  The training process utilizes the TensorFlow `tf.data` API for high-performance data loading and augmentation. This ensures efficient training even on limited hardware and supports caching, prefetching, and parallel processing.

* **Modular Codebase:**
  The code is structured with best practices in mind:

  * `train_model.py` handles model building, training, evaluation, and saving.
  * `app.py` manages the Streamlit interface and user interaction logic.

* **Real-Time Inference:**
  The Streamlit app loads a pre-trained model (`devanagari_model.h5`) and performs live inference on user input, returning a prediction within milliseconds.

* **Reproducibility & Clarity:**
  All steps‚Äîfrom data handling to model inference‚Äîare clearly documented, ensuring that results can be replicated across machines.

## üîß CNN Model Architecture

The CNN is designed to process small 32x32 grayscale character images and output a classification across 46 categories. The architecture is as follows:

| Layer Type     | Parameters / Details                             | Purpose                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Rescaling      | `scale=1./255, input_shape=(32, 32, 1)`          | Normalize pixel values to range \[0, 1]              |
| Conv2D         | `filters=32, kernel_size=3x3, activation='relu'` | Extract low-level features like edges                |
| MaxPooling2D   | `pool_size=2x2`                                  | Reduce spatial dimensions, retain important features |
| Conv2D         | `filters=64, kernel_size=3x3, activation='relu'` | Extract more complex patterns from image             |
| MaxPooling2D   | `pool_size=2x2`                                  | Further dimensionality reduction                     |
| Dropout        | `rate=0.25`                                      | Regularization to prevent overfitting                |
| Flatten        | -                                                | Convert feature maps to flat vector                  |
| Dense          | `units=128, activation='relu'`                   | Fully connected layer for feature synthesis          |
| Dropout        | `rate=0.5`                                       | Additional dropout for generalization                |
| Dense (Output) | `units=46, activation='softmax'`                 | Output classification over 46 character categories   |

The model is compiled with:

* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
* **Metric:** Accuracy
